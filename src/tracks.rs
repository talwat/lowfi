//! Has all of the structs for managing the state
//! of tracks, as well as downloading them & finding new ones.
//!
//! There are several structs which represent the different stages
//! that go on in downloading and playing tracks. The proccess for fetching tracks,
//! and what structs are relevant in each step, are as follows.
//!
//! First Stage, when a track is initially fetched.
//! 1. Raw entry selected from track list.
//! 2. Raw entry split into path & display name.
//! 3. Track data fetched, and [`QueuedTrack`] is created which includes a [`TrackName`] that may be raw.
//!
//! Second Stage, when a track is played.
//! 1. Track data is decoded.
//! 2. [`Info`] created from decoded data.
//! 3. [`Decoded`] made from [`Info`] and the original decoded data.
